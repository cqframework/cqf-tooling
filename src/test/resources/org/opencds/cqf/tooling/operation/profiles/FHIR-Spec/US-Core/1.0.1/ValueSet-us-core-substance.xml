This value set is quite general and includes concepts that may never cause an adverse event, particularly the included SNOMED CT concepts. The code system-specific value sets in this grouping value set are intended to provide broad coverage of all kinds of agents, but the expectation for use is that the chosen concept identifier for a substance should be appropriately specific and drawn from the available code systems in the following priority order:  1. NDF-RT codes for drug class allergies  2. RxNorm codes limited to term types (TTY) , &#39;BN&#39; Brand Name, &#39;IN&#39; ingredient, &#39;MIN&#39; multiple ingredient, and &#39;PIN&#39; precise ingredient for drug ingredient allergies  3.
