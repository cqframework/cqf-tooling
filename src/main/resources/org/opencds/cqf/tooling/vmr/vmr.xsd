		<xs:annotation>
			<xs:documentation>Unfavorable healthcare event (e.g., death, rash, difficulty breathing, a fall, or an adverse surgical event) that may or may not have been caused by some agent (e.g., a medication, immunization, food, or environmental agent).

Use AdverseEvent to model adverse reaction. An adverse reaction is type of adverse event that is characterized by an undesired or unexpected negative reaction to an agent (generally a medication or a food item). 

An adverse reactions can range from a mild reaction, such as a harmless rash to a severe and life-threatening reaction. They can occur immediately or develop over time. For example, a patient may develop a rash after taking a particular medication. 

In the case of adverse reactions, if a given agent is thought to cause multiple reactions, these reactions should be represented using multiple adverse events. 

Note that allergies are represented as special types of conditions embodied in the AllergyOrIntolerance class, whereas individual adverse events are represented as adverse events.

Note that a problem resulting from adverse event should not be confused with the adverse event. A fall is an adverse event whereas the fracture resulting from the fall is a problem.  In general, as a rule of thumb, if something can naturally be represented as a problem, it should be represented as a problem.

Iatrogenic issues should generally be represented as both an adverse event and problem where feasible. For instance, hospital-acquired pneumonia, central-line infections, or deep-venous thrombosis occurring during a hospitalization.

In some cases, the iatrogenic event will be distinct from the resulting problem. For example, an inadvertent liver laceration during surgery is an adverse event whereas the resulting liver bleeding is the problem.

Note that 'Never-Events' are adverse events while the resulting condition from these events are problems.</xs:documentation>

A class that serves as the basis for other more specific clinical statements, such as ObservationEvent and ProcedureProposal. It is a concrete class that can be used as is or specialized as needed.

Naming and modeling conventions:

	- in general, attribute names end in 'Code' if and only if the name of the attribute overlaps with the name of the parent class


	- times are named as follows: Time is the default suffix for these attributes.  EventTime is used to distinguish the time an order is placed vs. when the ordered act should take place. EffectiveTime and TimeInterval are used when there is a desire to emphasize that a prolonged time interval (e.g., &gt; 1 day) can be used rather than a point in time or a short time interval.  Note that regardless of the naming convention, IVL_TS attributes allow time intervals of any length.


	- subjectEffectiveTime is the time that is primarily related to the subject's experience of disease or treatment events (or durations), rather than when those events were reported or recorded by the performer


	- performerEventTime is the event time that is primarily related to the performer, rather than the subject.


	- the state between ordering and the ordered event occurring is modeled only in cases of procedures and encounters, due to the substantial rate at which orders do not result in events.


Approaches to representing specific statements:

	- No known allergies --&gt; NoKnownAllergy with conditionCode reflecting the type of 'No known allergy' statements (e.g., 'No known allergy', 'No known medication allergy', 'No known food allergy')


	- No known medications --&gt; UndeliveredSubstanceAdministration with substance that is the root-level code for medications.


	- No known problems --&gt; DeniedProblem with conditionCode that is the root-level code for problems or conditions.


	- Patient takes an unknown drug --&gt; SubstanceAdministrationEvent where code for substance represents "unknown medication".</xs:documentation>

If an upper-bound is not specified then the Prescription is open-ended or will default to a stale-date based on regulations.

A vMR may contain, for example, problems and medications or CDS-generated assessments and recommended actions.  Note that CDS-generated assessments and recommended actions would typically be considered a CDS output but could also be used as a CDS input as well (e.g., prior CDS system recommendations could influence current CDS system recommendations).

This model does allow for the presence of data belonging to related persons (such as in the case of family history, or public health infectious disease cases) for a single patient.  These related persons are modeled as EvaluatedPersons who have associated ClinicalStatements.  Note that this model is not designed to be a data model for providing CDS for a large population.
