# Contributing to CQF-Tooling

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes and the code builds locally.
5. Issue that pull request against `develop`.
6. `develop` is periodically merged into `master` to create a release.
