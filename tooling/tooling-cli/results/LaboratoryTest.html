<p>The content on this page was reviewed by the CQI Workgroup Conference call on April 6, 2018 for QDM version 5.3. The page is updated to reference QDM version 5.4. The only changes present in QDM version 5.4 is removal of the &#34;method&#34; attribute for &#34;Laboratory Test, Order&#34; and &#34;Laboratory Test, Recommended&#34;. The QDM datatype &#34;Laboratory Test, Performed&#34; retains the &#34;method&#34; attribute in QDM version 5.4. </p>

<p>QDM defines Laboratory Test as a medical procedure that involves testing a sample of blood, urine, or other substance from the body. Tests can help determine a diagnosis, plan treatment, check to see if treatment is working, or monitor the disease over time.  This QDM data category for Laboratory Test is only used for information about the subject of record. QDM defines three contexts for Laboratory Test: Laboratory Test, Order; Laboratory Test, Performed; Laboratory Test, Recommended.</p>

<tr>
<td>Components</td>
<td>Observation.component</td>
<td>QDM uses components to combine related observations to each other, e.g., a set of independent observations performed within an admission assessment for an inpatient admission. Each observation is unique (e.g., questions about tobacco usage, other substance usage, blood pressure, pulse, skin turgor, etc., etc.) but they are captured during the same patient-provider interaction. Such QDM components should map directly to QI Core / FHIR observations that can be linked to other observations. Other QDM component examples include multiple questions that are part of a validated evaluation tool (e.g., a Braden skin assessment scale). This latter example indicates individual questions that are inherently tied to the Braden scale instrument and the questions and answers do not have inherent value without being part of the instrument. QI Core / FHIR considers each such question as an Observation.component.  A general rule of thumb is QI Core / FHIR components apply only when the inherent value of the observation is defined by the parent observation. The result is that the content will determine if a QDM component maps to Observation.code or to Observation.component.code. </td></tr>
