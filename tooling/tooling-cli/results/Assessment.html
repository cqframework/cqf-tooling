<p>This QDM to QI Core Mapping for the QDM Category &#34;Assessment&#34; was reviewed by the CQI WG on March 9, 2018 for QDM version 5.3 and updated to QDM 5.4 on June 7, 2018. QDM 5.4 added the QDM datatype &#34;Assessment, Order&#34; that was not present in QDM version 5.3. In QDM 5.4, the &#34;method&#34; attribute has been removed from &#34;Assessment, Order&#34; and &#34;Assessment, Recommended&#34; but is retained for &#34;Assessment, Performed&#34;.</p>


<p>QDM defines Assessment as a resource used to define specific observations that clinicians use to guide treatment of the patient. An assessment can be a single question, or observable entity with an expected response, an organized collection of questions intended to solicit information from patients, providers or other individuals, or a single observable entity that is part of such a collection of questions. QDM further defines contexts for assessments: Assessment, Performed and Assessment, Recommended. Each context is mapped to QI Core elements in the following tables.

<td>Components</td>
<td>Observation.component</td>
<td>QDM uses components to combine related observations to each other, e.g., a set of independent observations performed within an admission assessment for an inpatient admission. Each observation is unique (e.g., questions about tobacco usage, other substance usage, blood pressure, pulse, skin turgor, etc., etc.) but they are captured during the same patient-provider interaction. Such QDM components should map directly to QI Core / FHIR observations that can be linked to other observations. Other QDM component examples include multiple questions that are part of a validated evaluation tool (e.g., a Braden skin assessment scale). This latter example indicates individual questions that are inherently tied to the Braden scale instrument and the questions and answers do not have inherent value without being part of the instrument. QI Core / FHIR considers each such question as an Observation.component.  A general rule of thumb is QI Core / FHIR components apply only when the inherent value of the observation is defined by the parent observation. The result is that the content will determine if a QDM component maps to Observation.code or to Observation.component.code. </td></tr>
