<p>This QDM to QI Core Mapping for the QDM Datatype &#34;Diagnosis&#34; was reviewed by the CQI WG on March 30, 2018 for QDM version 5.3. There are no changes in &#34;Condition/Diagnosis/Problem&#34; in QDM version 5.4.</p>

<p>QDM defines Condition/Diagnosis/Problem as a practitioner’s identification of a patient’s disease, illness, injury, or condition. This category contains a single datatype to represent all of these concepts: Diagnosis. A practitioner determines the diagnosis by means of examination, diagnostic test results, patient history, and/or family history. Diagnoses are usually considered unfavorable, but may also represent neutral or favorable conditions that affect a patient’s plan of care (e.g., pregnancy).</p>

<td>QDM defaults the status to active and prevalence period provides the evidence of activity. Note: The FHIR Condition resource does not specify a status for Condition.clinicalStatus; however, the QDM datatype Diagnosis default state is &#34;active&#34;; hence, the Condition.clinicalStatus should be constrained to &#34;active&#34;. Also, the Condition.verificationStatus should be constrained to &#34;confirmed&#34;.</td></tr>

<td>Prevalence Period</td>
<td>Condition.onset[x], OR Condition.asserted</td>
<td>Use Condition.onset[x], if present, use Condition.asserted as a fallback. Note that it may not be appropriate to map Condition.asserted to Diagnosis.prevalencePeriod.start when Condition.status is inactive. QDM matched to QI Core / FHIR for start of Prevalence Period</td></tr>
