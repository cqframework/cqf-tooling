<p>The content on this page was updated based on review by the CQI Workgroup Conference call on April 6, 2018 with reference to QDM 5.3. The content presented here is updated to QDM version 5.4. QDM version 5.4 removed the &#34;method&#34; attribute from &#34;Diagnostic Study, Order&#34; and &#34;Diagnostic Study, Recommended&#34; but retained the &#34;method&#34; attribute for &#34;Diagnostic Study, Performed&#34;. There are no other changes in QDM version 5.4 as compared to QDM version 5.3. </p> 

<p>QDM defines Diagnostic Study as any kind of medical test performed as a specific test or series of steps to aid in diagnosing or detecting disease (e.g., to establish a diagnosis, measure the progress or recovery from disease, confirm that a person is free from disease).  The QDM defines diagnostic studies as those that are not performed in organizations that perform testing on samples of human blood, tissue, or other substance from the body. Diagnostic studies may make use of digital images and textual reports. Such studies include but are not limited to imaging studies, cardiology studies (electrocardiogram, treadmill stress testing), pulmonary-function testing, vascular laboratory testing, and others. QDM defines three contexts for Diagnostic Study: Diagnostic Study, Order; Diagnostic Study, Performed; and Diagnostic Study, Recommended. Note that QI Core maps for imaging type diagnostic studies are mapped to DiagnosticReport; QI Core maps for non-imaging type diagnostic studies are mapped to Observation.

Other QDM component examples include multiple questions that are part of a validated evaluation tool (e.g., a Braden skin assessment scale).

QI Core / FHIR considers each such question as an Observation.component.
