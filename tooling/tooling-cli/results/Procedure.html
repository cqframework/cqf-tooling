<p>The CQI Workgroup reviewed this page in April 2018 consistent with QDM version 5.3. QDM version 5.4 updates were applied on June 7, 2018:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Removal of &#34;anatomical approach site&#34; from &#34;Procedure, Performed&#34;, &#34;Procedure, Order&#34;, and &#34;Procedure, Recommended&#34;</li>
<li>Removal of &#34;method&#34; from &#34;Procedure, Order&#34; and &#34;Procedure, Recommended&#34;</li>
</ul>


<pre>Note that while the QDM categories Intervention and Procedure are modeled identically and interoperability standards do not differentiate between them, both are retained in the QDM as they are more clinically expressive for clinicians to understand the measure intent.
</pre>

<p>QDM defines Procedure as â€œAn Act whose immediate and primary outcome (post-condition) is the alteration of the physical condition of the subject. â€¦ Procedure is but one among several types of clinical activities such as observation, substance-administrations, and communicative interactions â€¦ Procedure does not comprise all acts of [sic] whose intent is intervention or treatment.â€?  A procedure may be a surgery or other type of physical manipulation of a personâ€™s body in whole or in part for purposes of making observations and diagnoses or providing treatment.   QDM defines three contexts for Procedure: Procedure, Order; Procedure, Performed; Procedure, Recommended.</p>

Note: Procedure.status allows specification of completed but it does not assure the procedure was completed successfully. The FHIR resource Proecedure.outcome does also specification of successful completion but that element may be ambiguous. The Patient Care Workgroup is evaluating options to more clearly represent a procedure that successfully achieved its objective (objective is not currently available as a metadata element). Moreover, clinical care capture of success with respect to procedure completion is highly variable. See the QDM Known Issues for a description of the issue and a link to the ONC Jira QDM Issues page to join the discussion for QDM <a class="external autonumber" href="https://github.com/esacinc/CQL-Formatting-and-Usage-Wiki/wiki/eCQM-Known-Issues#qdm-procedure-performed-completion-time" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</td></tr>
