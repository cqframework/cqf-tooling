<p>Reviewed by the CQI Workgroup in April 2018 based on QDM version 5.3. There are no changes to apply for QDM version 5.4.</p>

<p>QDM defines Care Experience as the experience a patient has when receiving care or a provider has when providing care. The individual Care Experience datatypes should be consulted for further details. QDM represents two kinds of care experience: Patient Care Experience and Provider Care Experience. The main question for the CQI Workgroup is whether Care Experience should be considered an observation, or is there some other concept present in or missing from FHIR.</p>
