<p>The CQI Workgroup reviewed this content in April 2018 based on QDM version 5.3. The content has been updated to reflect a change in QDM version 5.4. QDM version 5.4 removes the previous QDM datatypes &#34;Communication, Patient to Provider&#34;, &#34;Communication, Provider to Patient&#34;, and &#34;Communication, Provider to Provider&#34;. QDM version 5.4 creates a new QDM datatype, &#34;Communication, Performed&#34;.  The previous QDM datatype mapping are retained for historical review. </p>

<p>QDM defines Communication as the transmission, receipt, or acknowledgement of information sent from a source to a recipient, such as from one clinician to another regarding findings, assessments, plans of care, consultative advice, instructions, educational resources, etc. It also may include the receipt of response from a patient with respect to any aspect of the care provided. Furthermore, it may include the conveying of information from provider to patient (e.g., results, findings, plans for care, medical advice, instructions, educational resources, appointments). A time and date stamp is required. QDM defines on QDM datatype, Communication, Performed.</p>

<p><b><i><a class="external text" href="http://hl7.org/fhir/communication.html" rel="nofollow">FHIR Communication Resource</a></i></b></p>
<p>This resource is a record of a communication. A communication is a conveyance of information from one entity, a sender, to another entity, a receiver. The sender and receivers may be patients, practitioners, related persons, organizations, or devices. Communication use cases include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A reminder or alert delivered to a responsible provider</li>
<li>A recorded notification from the nurse that a patient&#39;s temperature exceeds a value</li>
<li>A notification to a public health agency of a patient presenting with a communicable disease reportable to the public health agency</li>
<li>Patient educational material sent by a provider to a patient</li>
<li>Non-patient specific communication use cases may include:</li>
<li>A nurse call from a hall bathroom</li>
<li>Advisory for battery service from a pump</li>
</ul>

 
<p><b><i><a class="external text" href="http://hl7.org/fhir/procedure.html" rel="nofollow">HL7 FHIR Procedure Resource</a></i></b></p>
<p>The boundary between determining whether an action is a Procedure (training or counseling) as opposed to a Communication is based on whether there&#39;s a specific intent to change the mind-set of the patient. Mere disclosure of information would be considered a Communication. A process that involves verification of the patient&#39;s comprehension or to change the patient&#39;s mental state would be a Procedure.</p>
