<p>The CQI Workgroup reviewed the mapping to QDM version 5.3 in April 2018. The content is updated on June 7, 2018 based on QDM version 5.4. The changes based on QDM 5.4 include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Removal of the &#34;method&#34; attribute from &#34;Physical Exam, Order&#34; and &#34;Physical Exam, Recommended&#34;</li>
</ul>


<p>QDM defines Physical Exam as the evaluation of the patient&#39;s body and/or mental status exam to determine its state of health. The techniques of examination can include palpation (feeling with the hands or fingers), percussion (tapping with the fingers), auscultation (listening), visual inspection or observation, inquisition and smell. Measurements may include vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiration) as well as other clinical measures (such as expiratory flow rate and size of lesion). Physical exam includes psychiatric examinations. QDM defines three contexts for Physical Exam: Physical Exam, Order; Physical Exam, Performed; Physical Exam, Recommended.</p>

<td>Components</td>
<td>Observation.component</td>
<td>QDM uses components to combine related observations to each other, e.g., a set of independent observations performed within an admission assessment for an inpatient admission. Each observation is unique (e.g., questions about tobacco usage, other substance usage, blood pressure, pulse, skin turgor, etc., etc.) but they are captured during the same patient-provider interaction. Such QDM components should map directly to QI Core / FHIR observations that can be linked to other observations. Other QDM component examples include multiple questions that are part of a validated evaluation tool (e.g., a Braden skin assessment scale). This latter example indicates individual questions that are inherently tied to the Braden scale instrument and the questions and answers do not have inherent value without being part of the instrument. QI Core / FHIR considers each such question as an Observation.component.  A general rule of thumb is QI Core / FHIR components apply only when the inherent value of the observation is defined by the parent observation. The result is that the content will determine if a QDM component maps to Observation.code or to Observation.component.code. </td></tr>
