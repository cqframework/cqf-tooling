  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>This implementation guide contains common FHIR assets for use in US-based content IGs
    built using the approach and specifications developed as part of the Clinical
    Quality Framework (<a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CQIWC/Clinical+Quality+Framework">CQF</a>)
    initiative, including the USCore-ModelInfo and USCommon libraries.</p>
  <p>The CQF approach brings a suite of standards and methodologies to bear on the problem
    of authoring, sharing, and evaluating clinical knowledge, with the goal of streamlining
    the development and implementation of guideline-based clinical care.</p>
  <p>For more information on this approach, see the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cpg/approach.html">Approach</a>
  and <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cpg/methodology.html">Methodology</a> sections of the FHIR
  Clinical Guidelines implementation guide.</p>

  <h3>Contents</h3>
  <p>This implementation guide contains libraries that facilitate the use of CQL with FHIR in the US Realm, as explained in the sections
    below. To use these libraries in your implementation guide, include a reference to this implementation guide as
    an implementation guide dependency:</p>
  <pre><code>&lt;dependsOn id=&quot;cqf-us&quot;&gt;
  &lt;uri value=&quot;http://fhir.org/guides/cqf/us/common/ImplementationGuide/fhir.cqf.us.common&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;packageId value=&quot;fhir.cqf.us.common&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;version value=&quot;0.1.0&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/dependsOn&gt;</code></pre>

  <h4>USCore ModelInfo</h4>
  <p>Clinical Quality Language (<a href="http://cql.hl7.org">CQL</a>) is a high-level,
  domain-specific language focused on clinical quality and targeted at measure and
  decision support artifact authors. In addition, the CQL specification provides a
  machine-readable canonical representation called Expression Logical Model
  (<a href="https://cql.hl7.org/04-logicalspecification.html">ELM</a>) targeted at
  implementations and designed to enable automated sharing of clinical knowledge.</p>
  <p>To use CQL with USCore, <a href="https://cql.hl7.org/07-physicalrepresentation.html#data-model-references">model
  information</a> must be provided to the implementation environment. The <a href="Library-USCore-ModelInfo.html">USCore-ModelInfo</a>
  library provides this information for US Core. To use USCore, include a <a href="https://cql.hl7.org/02-authorsguide.html#data-models">using
  declaration</a> as shown in the example below:</p>
  <pre><code>using USCore version '3.1.1'</code></pre>
  <p>Although not required by CQL, current best-practice is to include the version of USCore.</p>
