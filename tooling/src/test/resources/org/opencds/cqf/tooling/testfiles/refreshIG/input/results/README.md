# Results

This folder is for posting results of measure testing evaluation. On completion of a $measure-evaluate, post the resulting MeasureReport resource here, with the following convention for the id of the measure report:

```
[participant]-[test-case-id]-results
```

For example, if ACME Reporting evaluated denom-EXM74, the id would be:

```
acme-denom-EXM74-results
```

Use a file name that matches the id of the resource it contains with the `measurereport-` prefix:

```
measurereport-[participant]-[test-case-id]-results.json
```

For example:

```
measurereport-acme-denom-EXM74-results.json
```

Also, please log the results of any testing in the measure content testing spreadsheet here:
