The following PlanDefinition files in this directory contain the release-bound PlanDefinitions for the eRSD v2 Specification Bundle distribution. They are intended as an input (manually) to the eRSD v1 to v2 transform process. The process calls for the PlanDefinition contained in these files (there is one file for each encoding - XML, JSON) to be manually copied into the input eRSD v1 bundle to replace the v1 PlanDefinition that is in it before running the Transformer on that bundle.

These files should NOT be modified unless it is explicitly to address a content bug or to bring into conformance with the ersd-plandefinition profile from eCR due to changes in that spec. This will eventually be moved to a long-term home, but for the time being will be stored and available here and should be left alone.
